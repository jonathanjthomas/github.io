>Jawaharlal Nehru

This is a quote by Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister, and it is also my topic for today: How we can achieve world peace, with a smile.
Today’s society is governed by speed. **We have fast food, fast transit, fast delivery and we dwell in a world that’s confined to our fingertips.** In this fast-paced world, we miss out on many things that used to be considered as important aspects of an ideal life. We lose out on peace. We don’t stop to look past our 6 inch interfaces and our 16 hour schedules to realize the number of relationships we’ve missed, the number of people around us that are reaching out for help, while we’re too busy dealing with our own problems.
In our own little world of challenges and pursuits, **we brush past the headlines of civilians dying on blood-stained grounds and on shattered fields.** We push past the crowd in the streets, not seeing that most of them face discrimination, either in society, workplace or home. We need to step out of the bubbles that we have created to realize the reality of peace. It begins in our hearts and minds. We need to step away from the cliche “Peace begins at home” , to recognise the fact that peace begins in the soul. It’s only when we harbour peace, that we can shine light in this darkness stricken world, and see for ourselves. **Some of the greatest peacemakers in history, such as Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King Jr., Malala Yousafzai and Mahatma Gandhi, didn’t experience peace for themselves.** Mother Teresa faced oppression by society, Martin Luther King's house was bombed, Malala Yousafzai was shot and Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned for several years. Despite all of this, they were able to emanate peace, not because they experienced it, but because they had peace themselves and this peace that was within them, changed the course of history.

Their examples all tell us a common thing, that we need to instill peace within people, in order to institute peace among nations. **But what kind of peace?** Unfailing, unconditional, infallible and unending peace. Such peace needs to be instilled in the youth of the world, peace that can stand the tides of war and the gusts of peril. It needs to be presented through the media we interact with, through the leaders we believe in and through the schools we count on. When such peace is active in each responsible individual, we can establish peace in the world.

We can do something ourselves to spread this peace in our everyday lives, through the concept of **”A Smile, A Word and A Helping Hand”**.This is an idea that I developed when I realized that a smile is a wire between hearts. **We can smile at anyone, at anytime and anywhere.** You may see it as insignificant, but your smile may have just made that person’s day. Even better, **simple phrases such as “How are you?” or ” Have a good day! ”** can show people who don’t normally receive appreciation that you matter to them. You don’t know their background, the situation that they are in, and what they’re feeling, but when you say a kind word, it gives them a moment’s rest. Finally, one of the best things that we can do to inspire hope in someone is to **lend them a helping hand**, or at least ask if they need one. It displays to them that you’re willing to go the extra mile, not for self-benefit, but simply because you care for them. You may not realise the difference you are making, until someone shows you love when you’re going through a difficult season.

**We often wonder how our tiny actions and deeds can change the world**. Sure, many drops may make an ocean, but will it really make any difference if my drop isn’t there? Well, if everyone said that, then there would be no ocean. If Nelson Mandela didn’t hunger for the freedom of his people, then we would have a very different South Africa today. If Jesse Owens decided that the racism he experienced was enough to slow him down, perhaps discrimination would still exist in the field of athletics today. These forerunners of the modern world were no one, until they started doing something to change the situation around them. You may think that your smile is negligible, but it may be the spark to light the fire of peace and change, in your home, your school, your neighborhood, your country, and our world.

” Peace is not a relationship of nations. It is a condition of the mind brought about by a serenity of the soul.” I hope you understood the essence of this quote. I wish to leave you with one question,**“Will you carry the light of this peace?”**
